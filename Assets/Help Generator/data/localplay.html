<h1>Local Play</h1>
<p>
    To play locally simply press 'Local Play', select a gamemode or save file and press play. 
    Then add local players or AI and change their teams as needed to fill the gamemode's team requirements.

    The AI may take up to 15 seconds to move. The better your hardware, the better the move the AI will be able to find in this time.
    If the AI doesn't find a move, it will make a random (valid) one. The AI's skill will vary between simpler and more complex gamemodes.

    This can be great for learning new gamemodes. You can play save files from multiplayer in local play and vice versa.
