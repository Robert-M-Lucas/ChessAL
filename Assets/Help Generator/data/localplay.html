<h1>Local Play</h1>
<p>
    To play locally simply press 'Local Play', select a gamemode or save file and press play. 
    Then add local players or AI and change their teams as needed to fill the game's team requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The AI may take up to 30 seconds to move. The better your hardware, the better the move the AI will be able to find in this time.
    If the AI doesn't find a move, it will make a random (valid) one. Expect the AI's skill to also vary between gamemodes.
</p>
<p>
    This can be great for learning new gamemodes. Remember that you can play save files from multiplayer in local play and vice versa.
