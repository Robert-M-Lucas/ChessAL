<h1>Hosting</h1>

<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>
    Click the 'Host' button and enter your name, the lobby's password (if you want it to have one) and select a gamemode or a save file.
    Once you have hosted a game you can click on a players team or their position in that team to change it. You will not be able
    to start a game until you have the correct number of players on the correct number of teams.

<h3>For players on the same network</h3>
<p>
    To allow players on the same network (e.g. connected to the same Wi-Fi) to connect to your game you need to give them your
    <b>local IP address</b>. In the future this will be displayed to you.
</p>

<h3>For players across the internet</h3>
<p>
    To allow players from anywhere to join you must give them your <b>public IP address</b>. You also need to forward port
    <b>8108</b>. In the future your public IP address will be displayed to you.
</p>
<h5>Port forwarding</h5>
<p>
    Every router (box that provides your internet) does this differently so there won't be any brand specific instructions.
    You can find information on how to forward a port by searching 'port forwarding <i>[brand name]</i>' e.g. 'port forwarding <i>Virgin Media</i>'. 
    The typical process is navigating to an address in a web browser such as 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1, 
    entering your device's <b>local IP address</b>,
    setting the port in and the port out to <b>8108</b> and setting the mode to <b>TCP or both</b>.
