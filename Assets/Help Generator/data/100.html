<h2>Piece movement</h2>

<h4>Pawns</h4>
<p>
    Pawns can move two spaces forward on their first move and one forward on all other moves. 
    They can take enemy pieces by moving one square diagonally-forward. The only exception to this rule
    is 'En-Passant' where a pawn can take another pawn <i>immediately</i> after it has moved forward two places
    by moving diagonally to the square behind it as if the pawn had only moved one square. If a pawn makes it to the
    opposite side of the board, it immediately becomes a queen.
</p>

<h4>Knight</h4>
<p>
    The knight can move or take any square accessible by moving in an 'L shape', that is, two squares in one direction
    then one in a perpendicular direction. The knight it the only piece that can make its moves by jumping over other
    pieces.
</p>

<h4>Bishop</h4>
<p>
    The bishop can move as many squares as it like diagonally and can take on the last square it moves to.
</p>

<h4>Rook</h4>
<p>
    The rook, similarly to the bishop, can move any amount of squares but in a straight line and take on the last square it moves to.
</p>

<h4>Queen</h4>
<p>
    The queen can move like the bishop and rook, that is, any amount of squares diagonally or in a straight line and can take on the last square.
</p>

<h4>King</h4>
<p>
    The king can move one square in any direction and can take on that move. If the king and one of the rooks haven't moved yet,
    there are no pieces in the way and the king is currently in a square that it can't be taken on and won't move through a square
    it can be taken on, the king can moved two squares toward said rook and the rook can be placed on the square adjacent to the king
    on the other side in one move. This is called 'castling'. The king cannot move into a square where it can be taken on the next turn.
</p>

<h2>Winning</h2>
<p>
    The game ends when a player cannot do anything to avoid the king being taken on the next turn.
