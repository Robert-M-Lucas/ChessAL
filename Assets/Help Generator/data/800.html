<h1>Viking Chess</h1>
<p>Despite its name, Viking Chess is completely different from normal chess</p>

<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>
    All pieces can move like rooks in chess, that is, move in any direction any amount of places (not diagonally).
    No piece other than the king can enter the corner squares, which ends the game.
</p>

<h3>Taking pieces</h3>
<p>
    To take a piece, you must surround it on two opposite sides with your pieces. A piece can be moved between two enemy pieces without being taken.
    The king cannot be used to take pieces.
</p>
<p>
    To take the king it must be surrounded on four sides or, if against a wall, three. This ends the game.
